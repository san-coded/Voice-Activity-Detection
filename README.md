# Voice-Activity-Detection
Based on Lawrence Rabiner's algorithm. Calculates Frame energy and Zero Crossing rate for every frame. After comparing with pre-set thresholds, it determines whether the frame is silent or not. If 10 silent frames are detected in a row, it assumes the speaker has stopped speaking.
